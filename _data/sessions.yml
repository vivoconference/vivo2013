  title: "Towards Digitizing Scholarly Communication"
  description: "Despite the availability of ubiquitous connectivity and information technology, scholarly communication has not changed much in the last
hundred years: research  ndings are still encoded in and decoded from linear, static articles and the possibilities of digitization are rarely
used. In this talk, we will discuss strategies for digitizing scholarly communication. This comprises in particular: the use of machine-
readable, dynamic content; the description and interlinking of research artifacts using Linked Data; the crowd-sourcing of multilingual
educational and learning content. We discuss the relation of these developments to research information systems and how they could
become part of an open ecosystem for scholarly communication."

  title: "Verifiable, Linked Open Knowledge That Anyone can Edit"
  description: "Fifteen years since the birth of the project, Wikipedia’s vision of a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit has come of age. Today, as one of the top
10 sources of global traf c to DOIs, Wikipedia is not only a comprehensive, multilingual repository of the world’s knowledge: It is also one of the
primary entry points to the scholarly literature and a popular vehicle by which scienti c knowledge is disseminated globally. In this talk,
I’ll showcase a number of ways in which this vision is augmented by Wikidata – the knowledge base that anyone can edit and Wikipedia’s
fastest growing sister project. By linking source metadata to facts and encyclopedic entries, Wikidata allows scholars, librarians, data curators,
software developers and volunteer contributors to share in the sum of a new kind of knowledge. I’ll review, in particular, the most recent
efforts aiming to incorporate into Wikidata a bibliographic repository and an open citation graph, to ensure that linked open knowledge is
also persistently and transparently veri able."

  title: "The Future is Federated"
  description: "For years, scholars, scientists, and practitioners in various  elds have been told about the importance of open data. Increasingly, many of us have been asked to publish Linked Data as well. While the publication of Linked Data becomes easier—not the least because of VIVO—consumption
often remains dif cult. As such, we might start to wonder: for whom are we creating Linked Data? In this talk, I will argue the importance of decentralization and federation on the Web. I’ll show with practical examples how we can consume Linked Data and make it work for us, today."

  title: "Building Semantic Web Applications Without SPARQL"
  description: "The Semantic Web offers an approach for integrating heterogeneous data and publishing it using widely-used terminologies to facilitate reuse. Even though SPARQL has been a standard for publishing integrated datasets to application developers since 2010, adoption has been low. Two critical barriers to adoption are the fragility of SPARQL endpoints to heavy loads, and the complexity of the RDF/SPARQL tool-chain. In this talk we present an alternative approach for publishing RDF data using JSON-LD and
ElasticSearch, a NoSQL data store. Our experience shows that this approach scales to datasets of billions of triples using commodity hardware, supports sub-second query response times for queries commonly used in Web portals, even under heavy loads, and uses a simpler JSON-based tool chain familiar to most software developers."

  title: "Scholarly Infrastructure, Sustainability, and Community"
  description: "While VIVO can be understood
as a platform
for creating and managing open linked data, paradoxically and in practice, VIVO can still exhibit elements
of “silo” architecture, often a result of
the institutional-centric orientation of many existing VIVO installations. In
an expanding ecosystem of scholarly systems, as well as the cross-institutional nature of scholarly communication, I ask the question, how does VIVO position itself for the future? In its earlier history, VIVO identi ed itself an open source semantic web application for scholarly networking and discovery (Borner, et. al., 2012, p. 4). What does this mean today? What are the present tensions and future opportunities for VIVO in an era when many new players have entered the  eld of scholarly and research infrastructure?"
