Dr. Szekely joined USC in 1988 after receiving his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. His current research focuses on algorithms and tools to acquire and reorganize web content to uncover hidden connections to create domain-specific knowledge graphs. These knowledge graphs enable users to use the web for investigative search to answer questions that are not possible to answer with traditional search engines. These tools are being used to construct knowledge graphs about cultural heritage, weapons trafficking, patent trolls, counterfeit electronics and human trafficking. The knowledge graph for human trafficking has been deployed to victim-support and law enforcement agencies helping them to identify victims and prosecute traffickers."
