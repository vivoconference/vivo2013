The Seventh Annual VIVO Conference <http://vivoconference.org/> will be
held August 17-19, 2016 at the Denver Marriott City Center in Denver,
Colorado. The organizers are pleased to issue this call for contributions

linked open data to promote scholarly collaboration and research discovery.

The VIVO conference is an excellent opportunity to meet with VIVO team
members from participating institutions. It also offers an open and
collaborative environment to share ideas and discuss topics related to
adoption and implementation of VIVO, VIVO-based tools and the opportunities
created by advancing data sharing and team science.

workshops and posters on topics of interest for the Seventh Annual VIVO
Conference in August. Proposals must be received by *Monday, March 14th at
5:00 PM EST*.
